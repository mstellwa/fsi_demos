## Implementation Learnings ‚Äî SnowBank Intelligence Demo (Historical)

> **üìã NOTE**: This file contains historical learning context and operational guidance. **For current technical and functional requirements**, see:
> - [technical_requirements.mdc](./technical_requirements.mdc) - Implementation constraints and patterns
> - [functional_requirements.mdc](./functional_requirements.mdc) - Agent specifications and demo requirements

## 1. Demo Success Metrics (Historical Achievements)

### 1.1 Final Production Status
- ‚úÖ 5,000 customers, 25,000 loans, 336K financial records
- ‚úÖ All 3 Cortex Search services created successfully  
- ‚úÖ Dual semantic view architecture with proper data (25K+ rows)
- ‚úÖ 34 Norwegian banking documents with required phrases (generated via optimized Snowpark DataFrame approach)
- ‚úÖ Perfect referential integrity (0 violations)
- ‚úÖ Document generation performance: ~34 documents in ~3 seconds (vs ~8 minutes individually)

### 1.2 Demo Scenario Validation Results
- ‚úÖ **Scenario 1**: Helio Salmon AS 360¬∞ (680.9M NOK, Nordic Bank Helgeland)
- ‚úÖ **Scenario 2**: Regional stress testing (267B NOK aquaculture portfolio) 
- ‚úÖ **Scenario 3**: Green bond reporting (623B NOK, 3,013 green loans)
- ‚úÖ **Scenario 4**: Alliance analytics (5 Nordic Banks, 534.9B NOK total assets)

## 2. Architectural Decisions and Context

### 2.1 Dual Semantic View Architecture Discovery
**Challenge Identified**: Multi-path relationship between `MEMBER_BANKS` and `LOANS` was not supported by Snowflake semantic views.

**Solution Delivered**: Separated banking data (`SNOWBANK_DEMO_SV`) and market data (`MARKET_PEER_ANALYSIS_SV`) into distinct semantic views.

**Agent Enhancement**: Agent 1 (Relationship Manager) now has multiple Cortex Analyst tools:
- `SnowBank_Portfolio_Analyst` for banking data queries
- `Market_Peer_Analysis` for peer stock performance queries

**Benefits Achieved**:
- ‚úÖ Clean semantic view architecture without relationship conflicts
- ‚úÖ Agent capabilities enhanced with domain-specific tools
- ‚úÖ Scalable pattern for complex multi-domain demonstrations

### 2.2 Simplified Setup Architecture Discovery
**Challenge Identified**: Dual script confusion (`main.py` vs `reset_demo.py`) and inconsistent object creation strategies.

**Solution Delivered**: Consolidated into single `main.py` script with consistent approach:
- Database: `IF NOT EXISTS`
- All other objects: `CREATE OR REPLACE`
- Always performs full demo setup with validation

**Benefits Achieved**:
- ‚úÖ Single setup command: `python main.py`
- ‚úÖ Consistent object creation strategy
- ‚úÖ Eliminated operational confusion
- ‚úÖ Reliable setup every time

## 3. Performance Breakthroughs

### 3.1 Snowpark DataFrame Document Generation
**Discovery**: Batch processing with literal model parameters achieved ~160x speedup.

**Performance Results**:
- **Before**: 8+ minutes for 31 documents (individual cortex.complete calls)
- **After**: 3 seconds for 34 documents (Snowpark DataFrame batch processing)

**Key Pattern Discovered**:
```python
# Group by model class and process separately due to literal parameter requirement
for model_class in distinct_models:
    model_prompts_df = prompts_df.filter(col("MODEL_CLASS") == lit(model_class))
    generated_df = model_prompts_df.select(
        cortex.complete(model_class, col("PROMPT_TEXT")).alias("CONTENT_MD")
    )
```

## 4. Demo Intelligence Strategy Discovery

### 4.1 Agent Tool Description Breakthrough
**Problem Discovered**: Generic tool descriptions led to agent failure in Scenario 1 Step 2.

**Solution Framework**: "Provide building blocks, not solutions"
- ‚úÖ Specific capabilities and available dimensions
- ‚ùå Hardcoded query patterns or scenario guidance

**Example Transformation**:
```
BEFORE: "Access to SnowBank semantic view for customer portfolio analysis"
AFTER: "Access to Nordic Banking Alliance semantic view containing customer portfolios, loan exposures, and financial data. Query by customer names, industry sectors (Aquaculture, Maritime, etc.), geographic regions (Helgeland, Vestlandet, etc.)."
```

**Result**: Authentic AI problem-solving while enabling successful scenario completion.

## 5. Data Accuracy and Quality Discoveries

### 5.1 LTM Fee Calculation Alignment
**Issue Discovered**: Semantic view calculated LTM fees as 0 NOK due to mismatch between calculation logic and actual data.

**Root Cause**: Semantic view used `record_type = 'Fee Income'` while data contained `'FEE_REVENUE'` and `'COMMISSION'`.

**Fix Applied**: Updated semantic view to use `record_type IN ('FEE_REVENUE', 'COMMISSION')`.

**Result**: Helio Salmon AS LTM fees now show realistic 442K NOK.

### 5.2 Demo Company Exposure Distribution Control
**Issue Discovered**: Random loan generation created unrealistic peer comparisons (15-20x exposure differences).

**Solution Implemented**: Added controlled loan generation for `DEMO_SEED_COMPANIES` to ensure realistic peer distributions for scenarios requiring "similar exposure levels".

**Result**: Perfect peer distribution (568M - 2.5B NOK range) for Scenario 1 Step 2.

### 5.3 Document Content Scenario Alignment  
**Issue Discovered**: Scenario 4 Step 2 requested "Q4 2024 quarterly reports" but only 2023 annual reports existed.

**Solution Implemented**: Added `QUARTERLY_REPORT` document type with Q4 2024-specific content generation.

**Result**: Agent queries for "Q4 2024 quarterly reports" now succeed with relevant content.

## 6. Brand Neutrality Implementation Context

### 6.1 Generic Alliance Strategy
**Achievement**: Successfully transformed from "Sparebank 1" specific demo to generic "Nordic Banking Alliance".

**Files Updated**: 6 core files with systematic replacement of brand-specific references.

**Narrative Maintained**: Compelling "Alliance Dilemma" story while being universally applicable.

**Adaptability**: Demo can be easily adapted for any geographical banking alliance context.

## 7. Operational Excellence Framework

### 7.1 Validation Framework Achievement
**5-Suite Validation System**:
- Infrastructure, Data Quality, Scenario Readiness, Performance, Agent Integration
- 80% success rate target with detailed failure analysis
- 15-second validation runtime

### 7.2 Production Deployment Pattern
**Standard Operating Procedure**:
1. `python main.py` - Complete setup (15-20 minutes)
2. `python validate_demo.py --output summary` - Validation (15 seconds)  
3. Configure agents per `demo_instructions.md`
4. Execute 4 demo scenarios with 15-20 minute presentation

## 8. Critical Success Factors Identified

### 8.1 Data Completeness Requirements
- Demo companies must exist in both banking and market data
- LTM fee calculations must align with actual data generation patterns
- Peer distributions must support "similar exposure" scenario requirements
- Document types must match scenario time requirements (Q4 2024 vs 2023)
- **Semantic view completeness**: All scenario-critical tables must be included in semantic views (discovered during Scenario 4 SMB data fix)

### 8.2 Agent Intelligence Enablement  
- Tool descriptions must provide specific capabilities without hardcoding solutions
- Multiple tools per agent enable comprehensive problem-solving
- Semantic view architecture must avoid multi-path relationship conflicts

### 8.3 Operational Reliability
- Single setup script eliminates operational confusion
- Comprehensive validation catches data quality issues
- Brand neutrality enables broad demo applicability
