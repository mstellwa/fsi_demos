# SnowBank Intelligence Demo - Agent Configuration Instructions

This document provides step-by-step instructions for configuring the 4 agents in Snowsight after running the data setup.

> **ðŸ†• Important Update**: This demo now uses **proper semantic views** created with `CREATE SEMANTIC VIEW` syntax instead of standard SQL views. This provides enhanced Cortex Analyst capabilities with embedded business logic, predefined metrics, and optimized natural language query processing.

## Prerequisites

**For complete functional and technical requirements**, see:
- [Functional Requirements](./.cursor/rukes/functional_requirements.mdc) - Agent specifications and configuration details
- [Technical Requirements](./.cursor/rukes/technical_requirements.mdc) - Environment setup and prerequisites

**Quick prerequisites check**:
- âœ… Demo setup completed: `python main.py`
- âœ… Access to Snowsight with Snowflake Intelligence enabled
- âœ… Cortex Analyst and Cortex Search permissions
- âœ… **Proper semantic views created**: `SNOWBANK_DEMO_SV` + `MARKET_PEER_ANALYSIS_SV`

## Agent Configuration Overview

Create 4 agents in Snowsight, each with:
- **Cortex Analyst** tool connected to `SNOWBANK_DEMO_SV` (proper semantic view)
- **One Cortex Search** service per agent
- **Claude 4.0** as orchestration model
- **Specific planning and response instructions**

### Semantic View Details
**Dual Semantic View Architecture** - Clean separation of banking and market data:

#### Banking Semantic View (`SNOWBANK_DEMO_SV`)
- **4 Core Tables**: `MEMBER_BANKS`, `CUSTOMERS`, `LOANS`, `FINANCIALS` with defined relationships
- **Banking Focus**: Customer portfolios, loan exposures, LTM fees, green bonds, alliance performance
- **No Multi-Path Issues**: Clean relationship design without market data conflicts

#### Market Semantic View (`MARKET_PEER_ANALYSIS_SV`) 
- **1 Focused Table**: `MARKET_DATA` for dedicated peer analysis
- **Market Focus**: Stock performance, peer comparisons, price volatility, industry benchmarking
- **Query Example**: "Stock performance vs top 3 aquaculture competitors"

Both views use proper `CREATE SEMANTIC VIEW` syntax with comprehensive metadata and are Cortex Analyst ready.

## Troubleshooting Agent Setup

### Common Issues

1. **Agent Creation Failed**
   - Verify Snowflake Intelligence is enabled
   - Check user permissions for agent creation
   - Ensure Claude 4.0 model is available

2. **Cortex Analyst Tool Issues**
   - Verify `SNOWBANK_DEMO_SV` semantic view exists: `SHOW SEMANTIC VIEWS`
   - Check semantic view structure: `DESCRIBE SEMANTIC VIEW SNOWBANK_DEMO_SV`
   - Verify semantic view permissions (SELECT on underlying tables)
   - Ensure semantic view has proper TABLES, RELATIONSHIPS, FACTS, DIMENSIONS, and METRICS clauses
   - Note: Direct SELECT from semantic views is not supported - Cortex Analyst handles the querying

3. **Cortex Search Tool Issues**
   - Verify search services are created and active
   - Test search services with sample queries
   - Check document content exists

4. **Agent Responses Empty/Error**
   - Verify both tools are properly configured
   - Check warehouse is running and sized appropriately
   - Review agent execution logs in Snowsight

### Validation Queries

Test each service manually before agent configuration:

```sql
-- Verify semantic view exists and has proper structure
SHOW SEMANTIC VIEWS;

-- Verify semantic view has dimensions and metrics
DESCRIBE SEMANTIC VIEW SNOWBANK_DEMO_SV;

-- Test semantic view data (Note: Direct SELECT from semantic views is not yet supported)
-- Instead, test underlying data:
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM FSI_DEMOS.BANK_DEMO.LOANS;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM FSI_DEMOS.BANK_DEMO.CUSTOMERS;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM FSI_DEMOS.BANK_DEMO.MEMBER_BANKS;

-- Test search services
SELECT SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX.SEARCH_PREVIEW(
    'FSI_DEMOS.BANK_DEMO.CLIENT_AND_MARKET_INTEL_SVC',
    '{"query": "algae bloom", "limit": 5}'
);

SELECT SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX.SEARCH_PREVIEW(
    'FSI_DEMOS.BANK_DEMO.INTERNAL_POLICY_SEARCH_SVC',
    '{"query": "forbearance", "limit": 5}'
);

SELECT SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX.SEARCH_PREVIEW(
    'FSI_DEMOS.BANK_DEMO.REPORTING_AND_COMPLIANCE_SVC',
    '{"query": "renewable energy", "limit": 5}'
);
```

**Expected Results:**
- âœ… `SHOW SEMANTIC VIEWS` should list `SNOWBANK_DEMO_SV`
- âœ… `DESCRIBE SEMANTIC VIEW` should show 44 dimensions and 52 metrics  
- âœ… All table counts should be > 0 (5 banks, 5000 customers, 25000 loans)
- âœ… All search services should return relevant document excerpts with proper JSON format

All queries should return results before proceeding with agent configuration.
