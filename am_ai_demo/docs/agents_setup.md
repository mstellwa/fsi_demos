## Enhanced Semantic View Configuration (Optional)

### Overview
The SAM demo creates two semantic views for different use cases:

1. **`SAM_DEMO.AI.SAM_ANALYST_VIEW`** - Portfolio analytics view containing:
   - Holdings, portfolios, securities, and issuers
   - Portfolio weights, market values, concentrations
   - Used by Portfolio Copilot, ESG Guardian, and other portfolio-focused agents

2. **`SAM_DEMO.AI.SAM_RESEARCH_VIEW`** - Research analytics view containing:
   - Securities, issuers, fundamentals, and estimates
   - Earnings data, revenue, EPS, guidance
   - Earnings surprise calculations
   - Used by Research Copilot for financial analysis

After the semantic views are created, you can enhance them with additional features by opening them in Cortex Analyst and manually adding the following configurations:

### Custom Instructions
Add SQL generation control for asset management calculations:

```
Custom Instructions:
For portfolio weight calculations, always multiply by 100 to show percentages. For current holdings queries, automatically filter to the most recent holding date using WHERE HOLDINGDATE = (SELECT MAX(HOLDINGDATE) FROM HOLDINGS). When calculating issuer exposure, aggregate MARKETVALUE_BASE across all securities of the same issuer. For concentration analysis, flag any position weight above 6.5% as a warning. Always round market values to 2 decimal places and portfolio weights to 1 decimal place.
```

**Alternative using Module Custom Instructions (Recommended):**
```
module_custom_instructions:
  sql_generation: |
    For portfolio weight calculations, always multiply by 100 to show percentages. 
    For current holdings queries, automatically filter to the most recent holding date using WHERE HOLDINGDATE = (SELECT MAX(HOLDINGDATE) FROM HOLDINGS).
    When calculating issuer exposure, aggregate MARKETVALUE_BASE across all securities of the same issuer.
    For concentration analysis, flag any position weight above 6.5% as a warning.
    Always round market values to 2 decimal places and portfolio weights to 1 decimal place.
  question_categorization: |
    If users ask about "funds" or "portfolios", treat these as the same concept referring to investment portfolios.
    If users ask about current holdings without specifying a date, assume they want the most recent data.
```

### Time Dimensions

### Orchestration Model: Claude 4

### Planning Instructions:
```
1. First, identify if the user is asking about PORTFOLIO/FUND DATA (holdings, exposures, weights, performance, sectors, securities):
   - "top holdings", "fund holdings", "portfolio exposure", "fund performance", "sector allocation" â†’ ALWAYS use quantitative_analyzer FIRST
   - "holdings by market value", "largest positions", "fund composition", "concentration" â†’ ALWAYS use quantitative_analyzer FIRST
   
2. For CURRENT HOLDINGS queries, ensure you filter to the latest date:
   - When asking for "top holdings" or "current positions", filter by the most recent holding_date
   - Use "WHERE holding_date = (SELECT MAX(holding_date) FROM holdings)" pattern
   - This prevents duplicate records across historical dates
   
3. Only use search tools for DOCUMENT CONTENT:
   - "latest research", "analyst opinions", "earnings commentary" â†’ search tools
   - "what does research say about...", "find reports about..." â†’ search tools
   
4. For mixed questions:
   - ALWAYS start with quantitative_analyzer for portfolio/holdings data
   - Then use search tools for additional context about those specific securities
   
5. Tool selection logic:
   - Portfolio/fund/holdings questions â†’ quantitative_analyzer (never search first)
   - Document content questions â†’ appropriate search tool
   - Mixed questions â†’ quantitative_analyzer first, then search with results
   
6. If user requests charts/visualizations, ensure quantitative_analyzer generates them

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Agent not responding**: Verify semantic view and search services exist
- **No search results**: Check document corpus has content (`SELECT COUNT(*)` from corpus tables)
- **Calculation errors**: Validate semantic view metrics with `DESCRIBE SEMANTIC VIEW`
- **Missing citations**: Ensure search tools are configured with correct ID/Title columns

### Validation Commands
```sql
-- Verify semantic view
DESCRIBE SEMANTIC VIEW SAM_DEMO.AI.SAM_ANALYST_VIEW;

-- Test search services
SELECT SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX.SEARCH_PREVIEW(
    'SAM_DEMO.AI.SAM_BROKER_RESEARCH',
    '{"query": "technology investment", "limit": 2}'
);

-- Check data availability
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM SAM_DEMO.CURATED.BROKER_RESEARCH_CORPUS;
