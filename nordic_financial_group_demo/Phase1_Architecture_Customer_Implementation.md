## Snowflake Data Architecture

### Data Ingestion Layer

#### Structured Data Pipeline
```sql
-- Policy data from PAS
CREATE OR REPLACE STREAM POLICY_STREAM ON INSURANCE.POLICIES_RAW;

-- Claims data from CMS  
CREATE OR REPLACE TASK CLAIMS_INGESTION
  WAREHOUSE = INGESTION_WH
  SCHEDULE = '5 MINUTE'
AS
  MERGE INTO INSURANCE.CLAIMS USING ...;
```

#### Unstructured Data Pipeline
```sql
-- Document processing with Cortex Complete
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE PROCESS_CLAIM_DOCUMENTS()
AS
$$
  -- Extract text, classify document types
  -- Generate structured summaries
  -- Store in searchable format
$$;
```

### Data Processing & Transformation

#### Golden Record Management
- **Claims**: Standardized claim identifiers (CLM-014741, CLM-003812, etc.)
- **Policies**: Unified policy numbering across systems
- **Customers**: Master data management with deduplication

#### Data Quality Framework
```sql
-- Data quality monitoring
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW DATA_QUALITY_METRICS AS
SELECT 
  'POLICIES' as table_name,
  COUNT(*) as total_records,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN policy_number IS NULL THEN 1 END) as missing_policy_numbers,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN effective_date > CURRENT_DATE() THEN 1 END) as future_dates
FROM INSURANCE.POLICIES;
```

### Analytics Layer

#### Semantic View (Cortex Analyst)
```sql
CREATE SEMANTIC VIEW NORWEGIAN_INSURANCE_SEMANTIC_VIEW
  TABLES (
    policies AS insurance.policies 
      PRIMARY KEY (policy_id)
      WITH SYNONYMS ('policy', 'coverage', 'insurance')
      COMMENT = 'Insurance policies with coverage and premium information',
    claims AS insurance.claims 
      PRIMARY KEY (claim_id) 
      WITH SYNONYMS ('claim', 'loss', 'incident')
      COMMENT = 'Insurance claims with loss and settlement details'
  )
  RELATIONSHIPS (
    policy_claims AS policies (policy_id) REFERENCES claims
  )
  METRICS (
    policies.total_premium AS SUM(policies.premium)
      WITH SYNONYMS = ('total premium', 'premium sum')
      COMMENT = 'Total premium across all policies'
  );
```

#### Search Services (Cortex Search)
```sql
-- Claims document search
CREATE CORTEX SEARCH SERVICE CLAIMS_SEARCH_SERVICE
  ON CONTENT_MD
  ATTRIBUTES ID, TITLE, DOC_TYPE, CLAIM_ID
  TARGET_LAG = '1 minute'
  WAREHOUSE = SEARCH_WH;

-- Underwriting intelligence search  
CREATE CORTEX SEARCH SERVICE UNDERWRITING_SEARCH_SERVICE
  ON CONTENT_MD
  ATTRIBUTES ID, TITLE, DOC_TYPE, MUNICIPALITY
  TARGET_LAG = '1 minute'
  WAREHOUSE = SEARCH_WH;
```
