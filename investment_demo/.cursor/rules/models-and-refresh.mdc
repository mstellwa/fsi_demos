# Models & Refresh Settings

## Models
- Unstructured data generation model: `llama3.1-8b` (configurable; set via parameter).
- Agent model (configured manually in Snowsight): Claude 4.0.

## Refresh & Indexing
- Create one Cortex Search service per unstructured source type.
- Set each service to refresh every 10 minutes.
- Run an on-demand refresh after synthetic data generation when preparing a demo session.

## Determinism
- Use a fixed random seed for data generation.
- Ensure anchor logistics companies always exist with complete coverage across sources.

## Localization
- Include 10% Swedish-language news items from provider `SnowWire Nordics` (`LANG='sv'`).
- Store all unstructured content in a single `VARCHAR` column (use markdown for content with layout).

## Title Generation Requirements (CRITICAL for Agent)
- **MANDATORY**: All Cortex Search services MUST have a TITLE column for the Agent to function
- Expert Transcripts: Generate title as "Expert Interview — [profile] — [date]"
- Earnings Calls: Generate title as "Earnings Call — [Company] — [Quarter]"
- News: Use existing `HEADLINE` field as TITLE
- Reports: Use existing `TITLE` field
- Memos: Use `SUBJECT` field as TITLE
- All titles must be populated for proper citation formatting in Agent responses
