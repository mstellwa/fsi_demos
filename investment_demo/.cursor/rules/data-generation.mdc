# Data Generation Rules

## General
- History: 18 quarters (structured) and 48 months (macro).
- Sub-sector focus: logistics; generate 10–12 companies.
- Deterministic: use a fixed random seed; regenerate stable data.
- MANDATORY: "Nordic Freight Systems" must always exist with:
  - Complete financial data for all 18 quarters
  - At least 6 earnings call transcripts with pricing power commentary
  - Coverage in news, reports, and memos
- Ensure other anchor companies have substantial data coverage.
- Regions: Nordics primary, EU hints. 10% Swedish news via provider name "SnowWire Nordics".

## Snowpark & Pandas
- Use Snowpark DataFrames wherever possible.
- If Pandas is required, load via `Session.write_pandas(df, table_name, quote_identifiers=False)` and ensure Snowflake-compliant identifiers.
- All unstructured outputs are stored in a single VARCHAR column per row.
- Use markdown formatting for sources with layout (consultant reports, memos, transcripts).

## Cortex Complete
- Model for generation: `llama3.1-8b` by default; keep configurable.
- Store prompts in a Snowflake table per source type with at least: `PROMPT_ID`, `SOURCE_TABLE`, `COMPANY_ID` (nullable), `TITLE_HINT`, `TOPIC_TAGS`, `PROMPT_TEXT`, `RANDOM_SEED`, `MODEL_NAME`.
- Run `complete` against the prompts table via Snowpark DataFrame and persist results to the target tables.
- Entity linking: include `COMPANY_ID` when appropriate (news, earnings, memos; experts/reports when clearly attributable).
- Language: tag Swedish items with `LANG='sv'` and English with `LANG='en'`.

## Data Volumes (guidance)
- News: 40–60 (ensure coverage of anchor companies)
- Expert transcripts: 10–12 (include logistics sector insights)
- Consultant reports: 6–8 (at least 2 covering pricing strategies)
- Earnings calls: 
  - Nordic Freight Systems: minimum 6 quarters
  - Other anchor companies: minimum 4 quarters each
  - Remaining companies: at least 2 quarters each
- Internal memos: 10–12 (include analysis of Nordic Freight Systems)
