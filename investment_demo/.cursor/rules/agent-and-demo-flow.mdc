# Agent & Demo Flow Rules

## Agent Model & Setup
- The Agent will be configured manually in Snowsight.
- Use Claude 4.0 for the Agent (per account availability). This rule provides setup guidance only.

## Tools & Selection Order
- Broad qualitative: run Search in parallel (News + Reports + Memos), then synthesize.
- Quantitative: use Cortex Analyst first; optionally pull quotes via Search to explain results.
  - "Top 3" companies determined by last_quarter_revenue metric
- Company-specific qualitative: start with Earnings Calls; then News/Memos as needed.
  - Nordic Freight Systems must have pricing power quotes available
- Mixed intent: gather qualitative context first, then quantify with Analyst, and synthesize.
- Language handling: Cortex Search should handle both English and Swedish content (10% Swedish expected)

## Response Instructions
- Lead with one paragraph, followed by up to 3â€“5 bullets.
- Always cite as `[Title] (SourceType, Date)` for every fact/quote.
- Generate charts when asked and add a brief takeaway.
- Prefer exact quotes for management commentary.
