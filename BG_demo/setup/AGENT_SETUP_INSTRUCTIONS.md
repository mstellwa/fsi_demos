## üîß Troubleshooting

**üö® MOST COMMON ISSUE: Missing ID/Title Column Configuration**
- **Problem**: Agent says "document indexing appears to be misconfigured" or "experiencing technical issue with search system"
- **Cause**: Cortex Search Service tools missing ID Column and Title Column configuration
- **Root Cause**: Search services must include `DOC_ID` and `FILE_URL` in ATTRIBUTES section during creation
- **Solution**: For ALL search service tools, configure:
  - **ID Column**: `DOC_ID` 
  - **Title Column**: `FILE_URL`
- **Technical Note**: The unified_setup.py script creates search services with proper ATTRIBUTES:
  ```sql
  CREATE CORTEX SEARCH SERVICE service_name
  ON CONTENT
  ATTRIBUTES DOC_ID, FILE_URL, COMPANY_NAME, DOCUMENT_TYPE, DOC_DATE, AUTHOR
  ```
- **Verification**: Test with SQL: `SELECT DOC_ID, FILE_URL FROM DOCUMENTS LIMIT 3`

**Search Services Not Working:**
- Wait 2-3 minutes for indexing to complete
- Test with: `SELECT PARSE_JSON(SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX.SEARCH_PREVIEW('RESEARCH_SERVICE', '{"query": "Tempus AI", "limit": 3}'))['results']`

**Semantic Views Issues:**
- Both FINANCIAL_DATA_ANALYST and CLIENT_DATA_ANALYST are properly configured with correct RELATIONSHIPS syntax
- Views include comprehensive SYNONYMS and COMMENTS for enhanced natural language processing
- Verify with: `SHOW SEMANTIC VIEWS IN SCHEMA SAM_DEMO`
- Reference file: `setup/semantic_views_reference.sql` for exact syntax patterns

**Agent Tool Errors:**
- Ensure you're in the correct database (FSI_DEMOS) and schema (SAM_DEMO)
- Check tool permissions and service availability
- Verify all search service tools have ID and Title columns configured

---
