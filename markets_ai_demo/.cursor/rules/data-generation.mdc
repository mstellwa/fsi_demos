# Data Generation Framework

## Master Event Log Strategy
The MASTER_EVENT_LOG table drives all data generation to ensure realistic correlations:
- Create 5-10 major market events first
- All subsequent data (prices, news, filings) must reference these events
- Events should affect multiple companies to show cross-sector impact

## Data Correlation Requirements
- Stock prices must show volatility on event dates
- News articles must be generated based on events in MASTER_EVENT_LOG
- SEC filings must reference events in MD&A sections
- Earnings transcripts must include analyst questions about events

## Unstructured Data Generation Process
1. Generate dynamic prompts using Python f-strings with structured data context
2. Store prompts in temporary Snowflake table
3. Create Snowpark DataFrame from prompt table
4. Use with_column() to add cortex.complete() generated content
5. Save results to permanent Snowflake table

## Data Volume Guidelines
- **Companies**: 10-15 real tickers (AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, etc.)
- **Clients**: 20-25 fictional institutional clients
- **History**: 1 year of daily data sufficient for demo scenarios
- **Events**: 5-10 market-moving events with clear impact patterns

## Quality Assurance
- Every agent question in scenarios must have supporting data
- Cross-reference event dates across all generated tables
- Ensure sentiment scores align with event types (positive/negative)
- Validate that geographic revenue exposure data supports risk scenarios
